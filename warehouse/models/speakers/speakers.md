{% docs speakers %}

Table contains information about the speakers which are presenters of the sessions or tutors in the hands-on tutorials.

Each speaker is uniquely identified by their `id`. The model also tracks their name, the pronouns by which they prefer to be addressed and a short biography.

The `role` column showcases their current professional affiliation including both position (eg. Data Engineer, Data Scientist) and organization (eg. Google, University of Minho). The information is stored as text in the format "{position} at {organization}".
